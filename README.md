# spotify-network-analysis
i need some help in accessing the spotify database in order to extract data about the collaboration of artists in songs.
i saw it is possible through pyton or similar softwares to extract data from the spotify platform.
i'm not a developer and i need some help for scraping
i'm not interested in users data, and i would like to analyse just a portion of the huge spotify database
the project should be carried out in R, which requires .csv files as input
the objective of the project is to see how artists decide to feature with other artists, within a label or based on common connections
